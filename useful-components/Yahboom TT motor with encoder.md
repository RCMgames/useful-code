TT shaped motor, with a quadrature magnetic encoder

## How to wire to a [Byte Sized Encoder Decoder](https://github.com/rcmgames/bsed)

A nice way to connect these motors to a BSED is to add Dupont headers to the end of the jst plug that comes with the motor as shown in the pictures below.

Plug the BSED directly into the QT/Qwiic connector of a QT Py or RCMv4 using a QT/Qwiic JST SH cable like [this](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4399)
